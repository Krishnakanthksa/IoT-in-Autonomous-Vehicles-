***IoT in Autonomous Vehicles***

This project explores the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology into autonomous vehicles (AVs) and how it is transforming modern transportation. 
The study focuses on how sensors, communication modules, and data processing systems enable vehicles to operate with minimal human involvement while maintaining safety and efficiency.

**Overview**

The report examines:
* Multi-layered IoT architecture in autonomous vehicles
* Key components such as sensors, V2X communication, and edge/cloud processing
* Major security issues including GPS spoofing, data breaches, and malware attacks
* Practical solutions and countermeasures to strengthen system security

**Architecture**

The IoT architecture in AVs is organized into four main layers:
* Perception Layer: Uses sensors like LiDAR, radar, GPS, and cameras to collect environmental data.
* Network Layer: Handles V2V, V2I, and V2X communication with 5G for real-time data exchange.
* Processing Layer: Uses edge computing for low-latency processing and cloud systems for large-scale analytics.
* Application Layer: Supports decision-making systems for navigation, safety, and control functions.

**Security Challenges**

Autonomous vehicles face several cybersecurity threats:
* GPS Spoofing: Manipulating navigation systems using fake signals.
* Data Breaches: Unauthorized access to sensitive vehicle or user data.
* Malware & Ransomware: Attacks that disrupt or lock vehicle systems.

**Security Solutions**

To mitigate these risks, the report recommends:
* Authenticating GPS signals and using multi-sensor verification
* Applying end-to-end encryption and zero-trust access control
* Regular vulnerability assessments and software updates
* Implementing intrusion detection and secure data transmission

**Conclusion**

IoT significantly enhances vehicle safety, performance, and user convenience, but it also introduces cybersecurity challenges. 
Continuous research and improved security frameworks are essential to ensure that autonomous vehicles remain safe and reliable in the future.
